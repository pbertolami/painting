> Project is a multi page website using Javascript , HTML, PHP, bootstrap, and CSS with the following information:.

1. Landing page includes a description of the website and its purpose.(Specifically it is a website for a house painting company) and a navigation bar.

picture and has text drawn over it that says Got Paint?
3. Their is a contact page with a form that uses javascript to validate
4. Although not required for the project their is a backend database that works
5. From the Home page their is a button "Have Fun and Paint" that directs the user to a painting canvas, an SVG picture of a house pops 
up and you can paint the canvas.  If you click the save button it saves the picture to the screen, however not to local storage
as their is not enough space. It also has multiple brushes and colors.
