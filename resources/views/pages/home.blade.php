            <h1>University Paint Pros</h1>

            <p>University Paint Pros specializes in exterior house painting and deck staining/maintenance.  At University Paint Pros we take the other painters to school. We take pride in painting houses.
                University Paint Pros is a group of dedicated young adults who like to paint houses.
                University Paint Pro was founded in 2016 to meld the needs of both the homeowner and the University student.
                Put simply we take young University adults who might not have a job and might not have any experience and give them training and opportunity for growth.
                We currently serve Connecticut residents and plan to expand to other States..</p>

        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As anyone knows paying for school is tough, and so is finding a reliable painter. At University Paint Pro we offer a solution for both.
        Helping young entrepreneurs and homeowners is what we do.  We give young adults a path to earn their way through school.
            In turn we provide homeowners with an affordable and reliable solution to upgrade or improve their home.</p>
        <p>A fresh coat of paint is the most cost effective way to transform your house.
            That new coat of paint can shield your investment from the weather elements for years.</p>
        <p>We have relationships with carpenters, roofers, and window installers.  If upon inspection we find rotted or damaged wood we will repair it.
            If we find their is a need for any other improvement that goes beyond our core competency such as window replacement or roof replacement or repair than we will make a suggestion and a referral of one of our trusted contractors. </p>
        <p>We deliver on time and in budget.  We can work within most budgets and typically beat the nearest competitor by 15 to 20 percent. </p>
